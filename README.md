# Overview

There is a list of game programming patterns in common use throughout the industry. Many of (all) these patterns can be seen elsewhere on the web including:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern
- http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/

This repository is similar to those other sites, except that the patterns are expressed in __javascript__ as written in the context of code running within a __web page in a browser__ or similar environment. In this way they are suitable for __programming web games__ in particular.

# Categories

We can in reality organise the patterns in any way we might wish. In practice software patterns are an idiomatic use of a language that have evolved organically. As a result rarely fit into one single category. Instead perhaps we should think of these as 'tags' so more than one can apply to a given pattern.

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Structural | Arrangement or structure of the code, or the software objects |
| Flow | Controlling the order of execution |
| Decoupling | Separation of software objects and types so they can be manipulated independently |
| Optimisation | Reducing computation, speeding up execution, reducing memory use |
| Other | No doubt there are other tags, what can we think of that is widely applicable? |
